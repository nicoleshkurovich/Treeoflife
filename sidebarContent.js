    <p>I use the hamsa, a hand shaped amulet, to symbolize my point of origin. In my Jewish upbringing, I often saw signs like the hamsa as representation of a people and place, that being, the biblical land of Israel (being different from the State of Israel). At the time that this map was made, the symbol evoked a singular story: the origins of Jewish spirituality and a Jewish ethnoreligion. Today, the meaning of the hamsa becomes more complicated: the hamsa, like my “place of origin” is not only to me, but rather, has significance to multiple cultures across a broad region. To claim possession over a symbol, like a place, is dangerous. Regardless, what remains curious is how a symbol depicted in art and architecture can help create associations to a place. 
</p>
    <p>As part of my understanding of my origin story, many argue over the “right to return” to the Biblical and ancestral land in modern day Israel/Palestine. To broaden the often narrow narrative prescribed by the Zionist project, return is not what I seek to do as a Jew of Diaspora. Even though I have gone back for education and travel, it is not necessarily a return home for me. Return necessitates a settling and alliance to a nation— to which I have not established: “the relationship remains latent until the individual chooses to make the choice to move there. As long as they don’t, the relationship between the individual and the state remains dormant.” In studying and experiencing the Diaspora, there is no doubt that diverse Jewish communities have a relationship to this place despite being outside the geographic, contested modern borders of Israel. Whether that relationship be based on “love”, “obligation and responsibility,” or citizen status, there is a muddling of whom Jewish diaspora is in direct relation with. 
</p>
    <p> The line or arrow that I use to represent the movement of my family within the greater context of Diaspora fragments and gets tied up in complex knots of how we can trace an identity. Changing the geometry of an otherwise linear arrow departing from the place of origin into the host count. Today, I identify my relationship to Israel as one based on significant critique, yet in a sense, I can still draw my line back, either in a spiritual and at times, an ahistorical way, or in this empirical way that Ilan Zvi Baron proposes: </p>
     <blockquote> “While Diaspora criticism of Israel is largely ineffective in influencing Israeli policy, it is nevertheless exceptionally important for Diaspora Jews for a very simple reason. Criticism is one of the few practices that provide an empirical connection with Israel on a regular basis. The act of debating Israel is to connect with Israel and emphasizes the meaningful authority that Israel offers which is then challenged or defended in the act of critique".
</blockquote>
    <p> Symbols like the Hamsa create a geography of continuity— both as an art form that can be moved physically from place to place and as a representation of the political relation between Diaspora and the State. Emblems, like humans, migrate and adapt themselves to new forms and contexts. As a symbol of protection, the hamsa interrogates who or what we protect? People? Land? Memories?

    </figure>
    <p>“Three days after the German invasion of France, May 15th, we left Antwerp” are the first words in the second part of my great uncle, Jack Silberstein’s, journal that he began writing as a 12 year old. During the succeeding years, my family made two attempts to leave the continent in search of refuge from Nazi persecution. Their journey was neither linear in geography nor in time: the path was uncertain, with no fixed destination. At times, they advanced toward safety; at others, they were forced to backtrack — even returning to Antwerp, the city from which they had first departed. </p>
    <p> My Arbol de Vida map enfolds many maps, one into another. The first is my Tio Jack’s original map. The next is the mapping that my family did during the summer of 2025, when my family traveled to Belgium and France to bear witness to the places my family left behind while just barely avoiding the Holocaust and other World War II catastrophes. During this time, my grandfather Edmund’s older brother Jack’s journal resurfaced. As an educated and anxious 14 year old, he kept a journal that detailed his routes, distance travelled, ways of transportation, and most importantly, personal thoughts. The journal enmeshed our family’s narrative into the larger context of WWII and the Holocaust. The journal helped our family retell a precise, detailed history, despite the older generation’s efforts to repress moments of trauma.</p>
    <p> Through many conversations between my mother, her uncles, cousins, etc., we we able to interrogate the question posed by Michael Joseph Holden in his work, “Mapping Memory: Cartography in Contemporary Holocaust Culture” </p>
    <blockquote> "In an ever-more-globalised world, in which diasporic communities, porous borders, transnational movement (and the concomitant transnational/transcultural movement of memory) figure ever more heavily, can Holocaust memory remain anchored to the spaces within which the events it remembers took place? As the last remaining survivors die, how do those who came later, and now view the Holocaust from the perspective of our contemporary moment, perceive the events? Specifically, how do they understand the spatiality of the event, and how do they represent the spaces of wartime Europe (and elsewhere) in cartographic form? Finally – and perhaps most significantly: What do their cartographic interventions tell us about the ways in which they understand the Holocaust, and the spaces and places within which it unfolded” (2020).</blockquote>

    <p>The voice of Peter Geffen stays with me today, even though I listen to it from a different place and context than from the one in which I first heard it. In Veria, Greece, with my Kivunim group, I visited one of Greece’s oldest Jewish quarters. As we were standing in front of this special ark, he spoke about restoring the glory of the past in us. I have come to understand that this restoration and movement between generations is very different from restoring the glory of the past in general. One is a conservative mindset, and the other is the type of memory that Michael Rothberg calls for in making the past present through memory. As humans, bearers of witness, listeners, learners, and ever experiencing entities, we fill these empty spaces with our memories. I choose to represent this story with an empty picture frame icon. The Aron Kodesh (holy ark) acts like an empty frame that becomes holy when it is inhabited by the Torah, a body of writing and tradition made up of words and memories. Maybe the empty frame is a microcosm of what the map seeks to do—create a canvas where memory can be expressed.</p>

    title: "On Keeping a Journal: Citizen Cartography",
    html: `<p>
When my grandfather passed away, my mother was given my great uncle's journal. She became both the safe-keeper of our family’s physical archives, but also memories that if not recorded, would otherwise have been lost. As we retraced the Silberstein’s escape from Western Europe, and their subsequent displacement from their home, it became clear that maps had a dual role in Tio Jack’s life. During the war, they seemed to act as a tool of self-preservation. Keeping records may have helped him cope, stay oriented, or tell a unique story. The maps, once completed, were also a reminder of the horrors endured. The map froze spaces and times perhaps meant to never be relieved, but in a way, they helped my family reconstruct sites and stories whose legacies manifest in our generational family trauma. Thanks to my great uncle’s assumed role as a family historian, he also became a citizen cartographer— an ordinary person using the tools of cartography to create new modes of knowledge production. His work later helped rewrite a narrative that was warped during WWII. At that time, maps were a weapon that authority used to dominate and erase a people. Tio Jack’s mapping techniques also proved that the Holocaust was rooted in specific geographic locations and spaces, where personal histories were intertwined with actual economic, social, and political events imposed by the Nazi regime. The specificity in place contradicts conventions about the “non-places” and the aporia of the fundamental “placelessness” of the Holocaust (Szczepan). The pictures overlayed, projected coordinate systems, and exact route ground the story in history and place, rather than keeping it as an abstract myth only able to be recounted verbally. The map builds on new attempts by cartographers to translate Holocaust survivor accounts  to “digitally map the geographies of their experiences—ghettoization, life in the camps, death marches, and journeys impacted by the Second World War—spanning Europe. Furthermore, some authors have tried to metaphorically “remap” the Holocaust through a multifocal analysis of various testimonies” (Szczepan). Thus, the remapping of my family’s escape out of Nazi Europe memorializes and builds on reconstructing misconstrued histories.</p>

    html: `<p>Wyoming, the ship that left Marseille, France, in 1941, was initially headed to Martinique. It ended up sailing to Morocco, where my family was held in a refugee camp, Sidi el Ayachi, near Azemmour. Whether my family spent their time figuring out how to survive or there were major events that were blocked out by post-traumatic stress disorder, the details of the four months at the refugee camp are mostly missing. In the end, they managed to get a medical permit that allowed them to leave the refugee camp. Once in Casablanca, my grandfather and his family obtained visas to enter Mexico. They took a cargo ship full of passengers, the SS Serpa Pinto from Casablanca to Mexico, stopping in the Azores and Cuba.
</p> 
    <p> The ship icon comes into direct dialogue with the actual landscape of the map— through this mode of transportation, my family came to interact with a new geography across the Atlantic Ocean. While visas granted access entry into new, potentially safer spaces, ships and the ocean facilitated that transition and escape. Thus, the icons are not just about what story they are trying to tell, but how they directly relate to distinct geographic features typically represented on a map like bodies of water and land. The representation of the ship comes to mean something greater than just travel: how detours and non-linear movements through the world are ingrained into maps. </p>

    html: `<p>My grandfather and his brothers made it to Mexico in the early 1940s, finding an already flourishing Jewish community in Mexico City. Here, another major transformation occurs: creating a shared identity with others who have been exiled. Though my grandfather’s parents never reclaimed the economic status they once had in Belgium, they were able to live comfortably and set down the foundations for my grandfather and his brothers to live comfortable, upper-middle class lives in Mexico.

    <p>It is important to interrogate how they were able to build identity and community. As a student of critical geography, it seems that this assimilation, or lack of, is inseparable from class status. Was it their whiteness that allowed them to enter into a higher social status already characterized by mestizaje identities, merging into the likes of the Spanish colonial legacy? Or was it the tightly-knit characteristics of the Jewish social networks that created an environment of insularity, yet camaraderie? Finally, it might also be that they brought prior knowledge from industrialized cities in Europe, where they had expertise as capitalists, financiers, and other industries they were forced into because of necessity.</p>
    <p>The Jewish community in Mexico City remains today, and the longer I spend apart from it, the more intense my curiosity to understand it grows.

    html: `<p>
“Ay catalina,” my grandfather always called to us as a term of endearment. Later, when he passed, I tried repeating the phrase to explain a painting I had just made of “catarinas”, ladybugs, and memories. Little did I know, I misunderstood what my grandfather had been calling me all my life. Catalina/catarina are in fact not the same word. Oops! </p>

<p>Either way, I adopted the ladybug as a symbol that would activate my grandfather’s memory. Wearing a ladybug necklace, taking pictures of ladybugs in nature or as stuffed animals in stores, signs allowed me to imagine and feel a live, tangible version of his absence. </p>

<p> Later, when my family visited Belgium, we went to his apartment. We concluded that this place was the beginning of their fleeing out of Belgium. As we were leaving, I saw a ladybug on a bush next to the entrance to the building. What a weird experience it was to be standing outside my grandfather’s first home, the place where he had to escape from Nazi persecution, and see a symbol that represents him. Was it him, or do humans have the tendency to make meaning out of something that is merely a coincidence? Being in deep connection to nature and trying to escape from the tight hold of objectivity, I’d like to think whether or not it was a sign, ladybug is an ephemeral being. Like memories, ladybugs move across the world, flee and return. I use the ladybug as a multidirectional marker of time and space.</p>`

    title: "City of Angels: Simulacra",
    html: `<p>
It was sometime late at night. A time that my mom wouldn’t have approved of. Our trek began at Griffith Observatory. We wore baggy jeans and baggy sweaters, obscuring our figures for protection. We shined our phone flash lights onto our dirt-covered shoes, as we ducked under trees and hopped over sagebrush that blocked our path. Our calculated footsteps turned into rapid thumps as we began to run out of pure excitement that we could finally see the view. It was everything. It was a grid of white and orange lights. It was a self-eating urban center, with a city sprawled around it. 
I pretend the city lights are little fireflies talking to each other, red meaning they are mad, pulsing rapidly each time they need more emphasis. I imagine a non-light polluted sky, and underneath it, the gray concrete is mineral-rich rock and the sewage running near my feet is fresh spring water. 
We got back in the car and circled around the neighborhood, crossing that Gothic-style bridge, strangely named after Shakespeare. We drove up and down canyons and made u-turns after hitting cul-de-sacs. We turned onto Glendower Place, and stopped just in front of the so-called “haunted house.” How could such a large Spanish style house, which must have once been covered with magenta bougainvillea and had perfectly manicured lawns, ever be a haunted house? We read up on the story, criticizing the reports that glazed over the fact that this was not a romantic, mysterious horror story, but rather a case of domestic violence. Nonetheless, we couldn’t help but laugh at how ironic that the murder weapon was a “ball-peen hammer” or that there even existed such a tool. How didn’t its creator think in advance of how teenagers would react when hearing its name?  
We didn’t know where to go next, so we just kept driving. About five turns after the haunted house, we passed a mansion that seemed vaguely familiar. A minute later, I scream “go back! go back!” We went back, as I commanded, and we rolled down the windows to get a better look. It was a Frank Lloyd Wright house. It was an architectural style I had never seen before: Mayan Revival. It hadn’t come up in any of the styles listed in The Architecture of Happiness or other books and articles I’d read before, but apparently it had been in Mulholland Drive, Blade Runner, and other movies, explaining why I’d recognized it. 
Do the deer and coyotes appreciate the architectural and engineering magnificence of this house, or do they just wonder why there’s less and less room for them to exist? Are they able to feel sorrow knowing that they won’t ever get their homes back, and only be further displaced? 
It’d be so nice to just love this city and not think anything else of it. It’d be so nice to just write a love letter and leave it as that. But alas, our land, our water, and our city names are stolen. Our city that is not a desert is turning into a desert. Maybe it’d be easier to love a desert, untouched, maybe less evidently doomed. The Joshua Tree still stands and the drought-tolerant plants still resist. </p>

It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion... A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The tree is filiation, but the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance. The tree imposes the verb 'to be', but the fabric of the rhizome is the conjunction, 'and...and...and...'.

      “I’m okay now,” he answered several times, “I’m okay now.”</p>

      <p>Zeide, I remember you, how you were a grand presence.<br>
      It is obvious that you will be missed, you and your sensitive soul.<br>
      Your language transcended words.<br>
      Your songs, your hugs, your eyes so light in color yet so deep in feeling.<br>
      You transmitted your affection to us<br>
      Without having to say anything.</p>

      <p>I remember moments<br>
      like your 80th birthday celebration.<br>
      Everyone in the family started crying after singing Las Mañanitas.<br>
      Some would call us crybabies, but<br>
      I think we have a gift:<br>
      In which we could all understand that we had a family and relationship so profound<br>
      That there is just no way of capturing with only words.<br>
      I think that is why you always asked me to keep making art,<br>
      Because it's the way we can…</p>

    title: "Futures: Off the Map",
    html: `<p>Upon reflecting on the life of this map, I think about temporality. The web map creates dialogue between my past self, when I first made this sculpture as a high school student, and my present. It even leaves the door open for change in the future. Through embedding writing, more images, and mixed timelines, what might the future map weave in? The map is multidirectional, in time and space, in ways that a physical map is not. Moreover, I have cemented the stories I think about into a more permanent conversation with the audience. While this may be an advantage, it may also be a limitation—are stories and histories ever more than just transient? Why must we create a static version of them?</p>
    <p> I feel as though for generations, my family, among many other people of diaspora or who have faced displacement, social and cultural estrangement, and political quandaries, have been trying to figure out who we are. It is as if this impossible task seems just too large to even begin unpacking. And yet, this map gives us a means to come closer to that. What unfolds if we take the time to travel through the contours of our memory?
